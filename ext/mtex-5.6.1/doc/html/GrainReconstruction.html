         <p>By grain reconstruction we mean the subdivision of the specimen, or more precisely the measured surface of the specimen, into
            regions of similar orientation which we then call grains. Note that there is no canonical definition of what is a grain. The
            grain reconstruction method that is default in MTEX is based on the definition of high angle grain boundaries which are assumed
            at the Mittelsenkrechten between neighbouring measurements whenever their misorientation angle exceeds a certain threshold.
            According to this point of view grains are regions surrounded by grain boundaries.

         <p>We see that there are a lot of not indexed measurements. For grain reconstruction, we have  three different choices how to
            deal with these unindexed regions:
         </p>
         <div>
            <ol>
               <li>leave them unindexed</li>
               <li>assign them to the surrounding grains</li>
               <li>a mixture of both, e.g., assign small notindexed regions to the surrounding grains but keep large notindexed regions</li>
            </ol>
         </div>
         <p>By default, MTEX uses the first method.</p>
         <p>The second parameter that is involved in grain reconstruction is the threshold misorientation angle indicating a grain boundary.
            By default, this value is set to 10 degrees.
         </p>
         <p>All grain reconstruction methods in MTEX are accessible via the command <a href="EBSD.calcGrains.html">calcGrains</a> which takes as input an EBSD data set and returns a list of grain.

         <p>It is important to understand that MTEX distinguishes the following two situations</p>
         <div>
            <ol>
               <li>a location is marked as notindexed</li>
               <li>a location does not occur in the data set</li>
            </ol>
         </div>
         <p>A location marked as <b>notindexed</b> is interpreted by MTEX as at this position, there is <b>no crystal</b>, whereas for a location that does not occur in the data set is interpreted by MTEX as: it is not known whether there is a
            crystal or not. Just to remind you, the later assumption is nothing special as it applies at all locations but the measurement
            points.
         </p>
         <p>A location that does not occur in the data is assigned in MTEX to the same grain and phase as the closest measurement point
            - this may also be a notindexed point. Hence, filling holes in MTEX means to erase them from the list of measurements, i.e.,
            instead of telling MTEX there is no crystal we are telling MTEX: we do not know what there is.
         </p>
         <p>The extremal case is to say whenever there is a not indexed measurement we actually do not know anything and allow MTEX to
            freely guess what happens there. This is realized by removing all not indexed measurements or, equivalently, computing the
            grains only from the indexed measurements
