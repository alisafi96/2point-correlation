         <p>If a material deforms through the movement of dislocations, rearrangement of dislocations to a low-energy configuration may
            happen during deformation (i.e. in slow, geologic deformation) or or afterwards (in many metals). In any case, the arrangement
            of dislocation walls can lead to so-called subgrains boundaries. If such a boundary is composed of edge dislocations, it is
            called a tilt boundary and the rotation axis relating both parts of the grain at each side can be expected to be within the
            boundary plane (ideally parallel to the edge dislocation line). If the boundary is composed of screw dislocations, the rotation
            axis should be normal to the boundary. Between those end-members, there are general boundaries where the rotation axis is
            not easily related to the type of dislocations unless further information is available.
         </p>
         <p>In this chapter we discuss the computation of the misorientation axes at subgrain boundaries and discuss whether they vote
            for twist or tilt boundaries. We start by importing an sample EBSD data set and computing all subgrain boundaries as it is
            described in more detail in the chapter <a href="subGrainBoundaries.html">Subgrain Boundaries</a>.

         <h2>Misorientation Axes<a name="3"> </a></h2>
         <p>When analysing the misorientation axes of the subgrain boundary misorientations we need to distinguish whether we look at
            the misorientation axes in crystal coordinates or in specimen coordinates. Lets start with the misorientation axes in crystal
            coordinates which can directly be computed by the command <a href="orientation.axis.html"><tt>axis</tt></a>.

         <p>The computation of the misorientation axis in specimen coordinates is a little bit more complicated as it is impossible using
            only the misoriention. In fact we require the adjacent orientations on both sides of the subgrain boundaries. We can find

         <p>Subgrain boundaries are often assumed to form during deformation by the accumulation of edge or screw dislocations. In first
            extremal case of exclusive edge dislocations the misorientation axis is parallel to deformation line and within the boundary
            plane. Such boundaries are called <b>tild boundaries</b>. In the second extremal case of exclusive screw dislocations the misorientation axis is the screw axis and is parallel to
            the boundary axis. Such boundaries are called <b>twist boundaries</b>.
         </p>
         <p>In the case of 2d EBSD data one usually has not full boundary information, but only the trace of the boundary with the measurement
            surface. Hence, it is impossible to distinguish tilt and twist boundaries. However, for twist boundaries the trace must be
            always perpendicular to the trace of the boundary as the trace is always perpendicular to the boundary normal. This can be
            easily checked from our EBSD data and allows us to exclude certain boundaries to be tilt boundaries. To do so we colorize
            in the following plot all subgrain boundaries according to the angle between the boundary trace and the misorientation axis.
            Red subgrain boundaries indicate potential tilt boundaries while blue subgrain boundaries are for sure no tilt boundaries.
